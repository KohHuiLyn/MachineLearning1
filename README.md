# MachineLearning1
This is my CA1 for my Year 2 Sem 1 Machine Learning Module.
This comes with 2 sets of code, one for a Classification Model and one for a Regression model.

Classification:
The classification model uses the data "agaricus-lepiota.data" containing data of different types of mushrooms like cap shape, gill size etc. It then attempts
to classify whether the mushrooms are edible or poisonous.

Regression:
The regression model uses the data "kc_house_data.csv" containing information about houses like house prices, date sold, etc. The model aims to predict the housing
prices.
